While some more recreational apps, like **Photo**, **Games** or **Music** are way behind the podium, being surpassed by more practical options such as **Weather**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight this makes sense: While not every iOS user will play long enough to a game to leave a review and it's not that important to know if a game it's good enough, other apps, like a GPS system or a Weather forecast are targeted to a broader target audience and the reviews are a key aspect. Many users might consider valuable to leave a review for an unrealiable GPS to save other people from the issues they may had experienced. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the main reason to develop a \"practical\" app for iOS. Users tend to leave a huge amount of reviews, which if we do our app properly could gives us visibility in the best way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second reason, we have to go back a little bit. The frequency table we created to display the more popular apps in the AppStore shown us that recreational apps are way more common, but it's harder to stand out among the crowd. While the practical apps seem to have more dedicated users."

We're working with strings, like 100,000+, and to perform computations we need to convert those to floats. But if we would that directly, due to the special symbols like ',' or '+', some kind of error would surface. For that we had to use the method **str.replace**, where we've subtituted those special symbols by nothing (using ''), going from 100,000+ to 100000, which is easier to convert to float and then, we added that number of installs to the total, and finally incremented len_category by 1.
